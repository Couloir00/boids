# To do

add parameters for model (scale, rotation, position, lod(later)<br>
find a way to redefine the avoid edges and boid class file structure to apprehend 3D<br>
add shaders from the TP<br>
add lights<br>
add drag for the camera<br>
as for the camera, compute direction vectors (XYZ) if we want to rotate the model (used in the rotation matrix later) reminder, use glm::cross for the cross product<br>
